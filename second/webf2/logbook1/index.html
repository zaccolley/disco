			<h2>Wild Man &#8211; lyrics - Kate Bush</h2>

			<p>They call you an animal, the Kangchenjunga Demon, Wild Man, Metoh-Kangmi. Lying in
			my tent, I can hear your cry echoing round the mountainside. You sound lonely. While
			crossing the Lhakpa-La something jumped down from the rocks. In the remote Garo Hills
			by Dipu Marak we found footprints in the snow.</p>

			<p>The schoolmaster of Darjeeling said he saw you by the Tengboche Monastery. You
			were playing in the snow. You were banging on the doors. You got up on the roof, Roof
			of the World. You were pulling up the rhodedendrons. Loping down the mountain. They
			want to know you. They will hunt you down, then they will kill you. Run away, run
			away, run away... While crossing the Lhakpa-La something jumped down from the rocks.
			In the remote Garo Hills by Dipu Marak we found footprints in the snow. We found your
			footprints in the snow. We brushed them all away... From the Sherpas of Annapurna to
			the Rinpoche of Qinghai. Shepherds from Mount Kailash to Himachal Pradesh found
			footprints in the snow.</p>

			<p>You&#8217;re not a langur monkey nor a big brown bear &#8211; You&#8217;re the
			Wild Man. They say they saw you drowned near the Rongbuk Glacier. They want to hunt
			you down. You&#8217;re not an animal. The Lamas say you&#8217;re not an animal.</p>
